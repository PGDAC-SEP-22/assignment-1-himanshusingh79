DBT Assignment - 1

Solution:
1) a. Entity Sets:
-> Professor: with SIN underlined as primary key,
-> Course: with CID underlined as Primary Key,
-> Semester : with SID underlined as Primary Key.
Relatioship Set:
-> teaches : associates professor, course and semester. 
No other attributes. The cardinality constraint is m-to-n. 
There is a single candidate key of the teaches relationship: {SIN, CID, SID}. 
The participation constraint can be anything; let say that it is total on professor and course entity sets.

1) b. Semester does not need to be an entity set here. Teaches is a binary relation between professor and course. 
Semester is attribute of teaches. 
The key o f teaches is {SIN, CID}.

1) c. This means total participation from professors and total participation from courses.
Because it is still m-to-n, the candidate key remains {SIN, CID}. 

1) d) This time the relationship is 1-to-1. 
There are now two candidate keys: either {SIN} or {CID}.
